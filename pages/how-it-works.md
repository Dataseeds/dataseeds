    <h1>HOW IT WORKS</h1>

<div class='header'>
  <p>How serious are we about addressing the challenge of food security in the face of climate change? Before answering this question, there is a second question to make: <span class="highlighted">How does the food we buy, eat and donâ€™t eat impact the environment?</span> Before reaching our plates, food needs to be produced, processed, packaged, and distributed. Every step uses up resources and generates more and more waste and pollution. </p>

  <img src="/assets/about/EEA.jpeg" alt="EEA how it works"> </img>
  <p>For instance, the role of transportation and logistics crucial in increasing food security, so we can feed 9 billion people by 2050, is responsible for up to 50% of harvest wasted between farm and fork. Transport-related emissions account for about 15% of overall greenhouse gas emissions. And 60% of those emissions are coming from road transport. Agricultural production alone accounts for 10% of greenhouse gas emissions (including 80% of methane emissions) contributing to climate change. If these are already problems to be considered, according to the European Enviroment Agency (EEA), 'climate change is projected to reduce crop productivity especially in southern Europe and to improve the conditions for growing crops in northern Europe, although the negative impact of extreme events on agriculture is expected to increase'

    <li>50 - 80% of nitrogen load in freshwater bodies, affecting water quality and aquatic ecosystems.</li>
