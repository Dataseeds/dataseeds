  <p>How serious are we about addressing the challenge of food security in the face of climate change? Before answering this question, there is a second question to make: <span class="highlighted">How does the food we buy, eat and donâ€™t eat impact the environment?</span> Before reaching our plates, food needs to be produced, processed, packaged, and distributed. Every step uses up resources and generates more and more waste and pollution. </p>
