			An important element in circular economies is waste reduction and waste management. Yet waste prevention is
			the most desirable option. The success of the EU moving towards a green economy thus rests to a large extent
			on conducting research and giving priority to monitoring and choosing adapted solutions to achieve a
			sustainable production avoiding food losses and pollution. EU open data on waste management is beneficial to
			optimise existing techniques and mechanisms by using the information different EU institutions and agencies
			have stored. SMEs can use it to enhance their waste models to move through the path of a circular economy
			hand in hand with EU principles, innovation and resources. Waste prevention will contribute to the efforts
			made to comply with several Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Agenda 2030. Production patterns
			need to move towards a responsible and circular model (SDG 12) to protect Life on land (SDG 15) and as a way
			of reducing climate change negative impacts (SDG 13).

			The map below allows for a quick overview of the amount of waste produced per country per year. Moreover,
			the interactive map also gives access to the most recent reports on
			<a class="underlined" href="https://www.eea.europa.eu/themes/waste/waste-prevention/countries">
				waste reduction</a> and

				resource efficiency</a>, which are available by clicking on the country of interest. These reports are
			based on a revision of existing national and regional waste prevention programmes, and information on
			resource efficiency, circular economy and raw material supply policies.

			The SDG 17, i.e. partnerships for the goals, requires effective
			multilateralism – to revitalise the connections among different types of

			EU have made a tremendous effort to keep updated about waste prevention
			initiatives and actions. Several existing platforms try to bring together
			different types of stakeholders in order to inspire citizens, companies and EU
			institutions to strengthen existing efforts on waste prevention and
