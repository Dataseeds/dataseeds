				<h2>EU LEGISLATIVE & NON-LEGISLATIVE ACTIONS</h2>
				<p>
					In order for the European Union to reach its climate-neutral objectives, existing goals need to be
					accompanied by innovative and ambitious legislative and non-legislative actions. This broad scope of
					actions includes inter alia policy proposals and new legal acts â€“ some are binding, others are not.
					Moreover, not all actions apply to all EU countries, or in the same way. Hereafter you will be able
					to find different types of legislative and non-legislative documents.
