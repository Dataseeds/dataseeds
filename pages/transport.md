				<h2>DATA</h2>
				<p>
					How much do food miles matter when it comes to carbon emissions? The role of transportation and
					logistics, both crucial in increasing food security and mitigating climate change, is a key element
					to consider when applying political ecology. Yet, decreasing geographical distance does not always
					mean better transportation. Other matters as cold storage facilities and transport refrigeration
					units are crucial parts to consider. At the same time, the more agents are involved between harvest
					and table, the less incentive there is for each agent to control costs and food losses.

				<h2>EU LEGISLATIVE & NON-LEGISLATIVE ACTIONS</h2>
				<p>
					In order for the European Union to reach its climate-neutral objectives, existing goals need to be
					accompanied by innovative and ambitious legislative and non-legislative actions. This broad scope of
					actions includes inter alia policy proposals and new legal acts â€“ some are binding, others are not.
					Moreover, not all actions apply to all EU countries, or in the same way. Hereafter you will be able
					to find different types of legislative and non-legislative documents.
