				<h2>DATA</h2>
				<p>
				Cleaner production and resource efficiency is a key element to ensure a greener and more circular economy. Often, agricultural practices, especially in SMEs, do not get to be designed specifically for the type of crop or farming that is taking place, and instead, they use standard systems. In the following map, we have compiled data from the last few years to see how resources are being used and sometimes wasted because of lack of funds.

				<h2>EU LEGISLATIVE & NON-LEGISLATIVE ACTIONS</h2>
				<p>
				In order for the European Union to reach its climate-neutral objectives, existing goals need to be
				accompanied by innovative and ambitious legislative and non-legislative actions. This broad scope of
				actions includes inter alia policy proposals and new legal acts â€“ some are binding, others are not.
				Moreover, not all actions apply to all EU countries, or in the same way. Hereafter you will be able to
				find different types of legislative and non-legislative documents.
