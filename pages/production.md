				<h2>DATA</h2>
				<p>
					Cleaner production and resource efficiency is a key element to ensure a greener and more circular
					economy. Often, agricultural practices, especially in SMEs, do not get to be designed specifically
					for the type of crop or farming that is taking place, and instead, they use standard systems. In the
					following map, we have compiled data from the last few years to see how resources are being used and
					sometimes wasted because of lack of funds.

				<h2>EU LEGISLATIVE & NON-LEGISLATIVE ACTIONS</h2>
				<p>
					In order for the European Union to reach its climate-neutral objectives, existing goals need to be
					accompanied by innovative and ambitious legislative and non-legislative actions. This broad scope of
					actions includes inter alia policy proposals and new legal acts â€“ some are binding, others are not.
					Moreover, not all actions apply to all EU countries, or in the same way. Hereafter you will be able
					to find different types of legislative and non-legislative documents.

				<p>
				In this section, you will be able to find information about the European funds destined towards agricultural reform and how they have been spent</span> by every Member State. The map showcases the amount agreed to for every state until 2023, what was finally allocated to each state, as well as, how much of it has been spent so far. Through this page you can also, access the CORDIS database where agricultural innovation projects of interest being carried out through Europe are shown in an interactive
				map.
