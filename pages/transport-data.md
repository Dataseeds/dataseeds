			Sustainable transport figures at the core of the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Although there is not a single goal that concerns transports on its own, cleaner transport is needed to address a range of climate change and sustainability objectives. Related to SDG 2 on Zero Hunger, an indirect target related to sustainable transport is agricultural productivity. In close connection with SDG 3 on Good Health and Well-being, cleaner transport would have a positive impact on air pollution. Hence, energy efficiency (SDG 7) would also have a say in this transition towards sustainability in transport. Finally, cleaner transport obeys also the SDGs 12 and 13 objectives of Responsible Consumption and Production, and Climate Action respectively. A reduction of fossil-fuel subsidies, consistent with a circular economy, is also in line with climate change mitigation strategies.

			<span class="highlighted">How much do food miles matter when it comes to carbon emissions?</span> The role
			of transportation and logistics, both crucial in increasing food security and mitigating climate change, is
			a key element to consider when applying political ecology. Yet, <span class="highlighted">decreasing
				geographical distance does not always mean better transportation</span>. Other matters as cold storage
			facilities and transport refrigeration units are crucial parts to consider. At the same time, the more
			agents are involved between harvest and table, the less incentive there is for each agent to control costs
			and food losses.

			In this context, Dataseeds considers two specific pillars to feed the future through a more sustainable
			transport logistic: First, to encourage a less carbon-intensive value chains. Second, to improve
			agro-logistics by reducing the costs as well as food losses.

						Emissions from agriculture and transport continue to pose problems for European Union Member States in meeting EU and United Nations air pollution limits, according to updated data published by the European Environment Agency (EEA) today. While emissions of most air pollutants remain on a downward trend, ammonia emissions continued to rise in 2016. <a class="underlined"
