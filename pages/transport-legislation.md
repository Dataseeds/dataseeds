  In order for the European Union to reach its climate-neutral objectives, existing goals need to be accompanied by innovative and ambitious legislative and non-legislative actions. This broad scope of actions includes <i>inter alia</i> policy proposals and new legal acts – some are binding, others are not. Moreover, not all actions apply to all EU countries, or in the same way. Hereafter you will be able to find legislative and non-legislative documents on <b>clean and efficient production</b>.

  <ul style="margin-left: 15px">
    <li>
      <p><b>Regulations (Article 288 TFEU)</b>
        Every regulation in force has a binding effect. It has a direct application across the EU.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><b>Directives (Article 288 TFEU)</b>
        A directive is a legislative act that establishes a particular objective that all EU countries much
        reach. Member States are free to choose how to achieve the goals established by the directive.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><b>Decisions (Article 288 TFEU)</b>
        A decision is binding in its entirety. However, it could have one or more addressees (one or several
        EU
        countries, companies or even individuals). In this case, it shall be binding on the concerned
        parties.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><b>Policy non-binding documents (Article 290 TFEU)</b>
        Policies are developed to benefit citizens, businesses, and other set of stakeholders. EU
        non-legislative acts of general application can be adopted or proposed to complement or amend
        non-essential elements of legislative acts. For example, a Communication is a policy document which
        relates with a particular initiative but has no legal effect.
